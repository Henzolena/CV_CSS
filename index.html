                <p id="skill-header-detail">As a software developer, I understand the importance of programming languages in
                    creating applications for various industries and platforms. In my experience, I have worked with
                    several high-level languages, including JavaScript, Java, Python, C, and C++. To be proficient in
                    these languages, I have developed skills in writing, debugging, and optimizing code. Additionally, I
                    have a strong understanding of OOP principles and functional programming concepts, as well as
                    knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and database systems. I have also gained experience in
                    memory management and pointer arithmetic and have worked with multithreaded programming and
                    concurrency. Familiarity with popular libraries and frameworks for each language is also essential
                    to my work. Lastly, I recognize the importance of understanding runtime environments and differences
                    between languages to ensure that applications run efficiently and effectively.
